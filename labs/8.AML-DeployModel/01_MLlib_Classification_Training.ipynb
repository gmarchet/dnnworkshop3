In this lab we will focus on a single algorithm - Gradient-boosted tree classifier - however in most cases you should go through a more thorough model selection process to find an algorithm that best fits you scenario and training data. We will also demonstrate how to automate hyperparameter tuning using Spark ML validators.\n\nTo achieve it, we will put together a simple Spark ML Pipeline.\n\nMost Spark ML algorithms, including GBT, expect the training data to be provided as a *numeric* column to represent the label and a column of type *Vector* to represent the features. \n\nThe features in our datasets are a mix of *numeric* and *string* values. *String* columns represent categorical features. Most *numeric* columns are continous features. Before we can configure hyper parameter tuning and Random Forest stages of our pipeline we will need to add a few data transformation steps.\n\nOur complete pipeline has the following stages:\n\n* `StringIndexer`: Convert string columns to categorical features\n* `VectorAssembler`: Assemble the feature columns into a feature vector.\n* `VectorIndexer`: Identify columns which should be treated as categorical. This is done heuristically, identifying any column with a small number of distinct values as being categorical.  For us, this will include columns like `occupation` or `homeowner` .\n* `Classifier`: This stage will train the classification algorithm.\n* `CrossValidator`: The machine learning algorithms have several [hyperparameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization), and tuning them to our data can improve performance of the model.  We will do this tuning using Spark's [Cross Validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_&#40;statistics&#41;) framework, which automatically tests a grid of hyperparameters and chooses the best.\n\n![Image of Pipeline](https://github.com/jakazmie/images-for-hands-on-labs/raw/master/pipeline.png)"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["First, we define the feature processing stages of the Pipeline:\n* Convert string columns to categorical features. \n* Assemble feature columns into a feature vector. \n* Identify categorical features, and index them.\n![Image of feature processing](https://github.com/jakazmie/images-for-hands-on-labs/raw/master/features.png)"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from pyspark.ml.feature import StringIndexer, VectorAssembler, VectorIndexer\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import *\nfrom pyspark.ml import Pipeline\n\n# Create a list of string indexers - one for each string column\nstringCols = [field.name for field in train.schema if field.dataType == StringType()]\nstringIndexers = [StringIndexer().setInputCol(name).setOutputCol(name+\"_idx\") for name in stringCols]\n\n# Get a list of all numeric columns\nnumericCols = [field.name for field in train.schema if field.dataType != StringType()]\n\n# Remove a label column\nnumericCols.remove('churn')\n\n# Create a list of all feature columns\nfeatureCols = numericCols + [name + \"_idx\" for name in stringCols]\n\n# This concatenates all feature columns into a single feature vector in a new column \"rawFeatures\".\nvectorAssembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=featureCols, outputCol=\"rawFeatures\")\n\n# This identifies categorical features and indexes them.\nvectorIndexer = VectorIndexer(inputCol=\"rawFeatures\", outputCol=\"features\", maxCategories=4)\n\n# Create a pipeline\nstages = stringIndexers + [vectorAssembler, vectorIndexer]\npipeline = Pipeline(stages=stages)\n\n# Check the Pipeline operation\ndisplay(pipeline.fit(train).transform(train))\n"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Second, we define the model training stage of the Pipeline. `GBTClassifier` takes feature vectors and labels as input and learns to predict labels of new examples.\n![RF image](https://github.com/jakazmie/images-for-hands-on-labs/raw/master/train.png)"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from pyspark.ml.classification import GBTClassifier\n# Takes the \"features\" column and learns to predict \"churn\"\nclassifier = GBTClassifier(labelCol=\"churn\", featuresCol=\"features\", maxBins=50)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":26},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Third, we wrap the model training stage within a `CrossValidator` stage.  `CrossValidator` knows how to call the classifier algorithm with different hyperparameter settings.
